# FANG LeetCode Questions — DSA Solutions in Java

A curated collection of LeetCode problems commonly asked at **FAANG/MAANG** companies (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google), organized by data structure and algorithm pattern. All solutions are written in **Java**.

## Topics Covered

| Topic | Folder |
|-------|--------|
| Binary Search | `BinarySearch/` |
| Graph | `Graph/` |
| Greedy | `Greedy/` |
| Heap / Priority Queue | `Heap/` |
| Linked List | `LinkedList/` |
| Prefix Sum | `PrefixSum/` |
| Stack | `Stack/` |
| Trees | `Trees/` |
| Two Pointers | `TwoPointers/` |

## Purpose

This repo focuses specifically on patterns that appear repeatedly in FAANG interviews. Rather than grinding random problems, this collection targets the highest-signal patterns that interviewers at top companies return to again and again.

---

## How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashikarNEU/FANG_leetcode_questions.git
cd FANG_leetcode_questions

# Navigate to a pattern
cd Graph
```

Each folder contains `.java` files named after the LeetCode problem for easy cross-referencing.

## Setup

- **Language**: Java (JDK 17+)
- No build system required — each solution file is standalone

```bash
javac ProblemName.java
java ProblemName
```

## Key Patterns & What to Know

**Binary Search** — Search in rotated array, find minimum in rotated array, median of two sorted arrays

**Graphs** — BFS/DFS, number of islands, clone graph, course schedule (topological sort), word ladder

**Greedy** — Jump game, meeting rooms, task scheduler, gas station

**Heap** — Top K elements, merge K sorted lists, find median from data stream

**Linked List** — Reverse linked list, detect cycle, merge sorted lists, LRU cache

**Prefix Sum** — Range sum query, subarray sum equals K

**Stack** — Valid parentheses, daily temperatures, largest rectangle in histogram

**Trees** — Level order traversal, lowest common ancestor, serialize/deserialize binary tree

**Two Pointers** — Container with most water, 3Sum, trapping rain water
